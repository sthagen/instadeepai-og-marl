# --- Logging options ---

base_exp_path: results # Base path for logging.
use_console: True # Whether to log to stdout.
use_tb: False # Whether to use tensorboard logging.
use_json: True # Whether to log marl-eval style to json files.
use_neptune: False  # Whether to log to neptune.ai.

# --- Other logger kwargs ---
kwargs:
  neptune_project: NeurIPS-2025-submission
  neptune_tag: [oryx]
  detailed_neptune_logging: False  # having mean/std/min/max can clutter neptune so we make it optional
  json_path: ~ # If set, json files will be logged to a set path so that multiple experiments can
    # write to the same json file for easy downstream aggregation and plotting with marl-eval.
  upload_json_data: True # Whether JSON file data should be uploaded to Neptune for downstream
    # aggregation and plotting of data from multiple experiments. Note that when uploading JSON files,
    # `json_path` must be unset to ensure that uploaded json files don't continue getting larger
    # over time. Setting both will break.

# --- Checkpointing ---
checkpointing:
  save_model: False # Whether to save model checkpoints.
  upload_model: False # Whether to store model weights to Neptune.

  save_args:
    save_interval_steps: 1 # Number of steps between saving checkpoints.
    max_to_keep: 1 # Maximum number of checkpoints to keep.
    keep_period: ~ # Don't delete any checkpoint where step % keep_period == 0
    checkpoint_uid: ~ # Unique identifier for checkpoint to save. Defaults to timestamp

  load_model: False # Whether to load model checkpoints.
  download_model: False # Wether to download a checkpoint from Neptune.

  download_args:
    neptune_run_name: "" # The name of the Neptune run that has the checkpoint.
      # It will always be something like MAR-... for the inference project.
  load_args:
    checkpoint_uid: "" # Unique identifier for checkpoint to load.
